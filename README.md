# ⚛️ React Learning Project (Meal / Product App)

This is a simple React project where I practiced and learned core React concepts by building a small meal/product-based UI.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Project

The main goal of this project is to understand and practice fundamental React concepts, not to build a production-level application.

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

In this project, I practiced:

* React state management (`useState`)
* Side effects with `useEffect`
* Props (parent → child data passing)
* Lifting state up (child → parent communication)
* Handling data flow between components
* Basic event handling (button click)
* Image import and usage in React
* Simple notification system (Toastify)
* Rendering dynamic data from API
* Basic component structure

---

## 🛒 Features

* Display meals/products from an API
* Show product image and title
* "Buy Now" button functionality
* Add to cart / simple interaction system
* Basic UI using CSS

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* React
* Vite
* CSS
* React Toastify

## 🌐 API Used

Data fetched from:

👉 https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/search.php?f=a

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

* Data is fetched from an API using `useEffect`
* Stored in state using `useState`
* Passed down to child components via props
* Button click triggers actions (like "Buy Now")
* State is lifted up to manage shared data

---

## 🎨 UI

* Simple layout using basic CSS
* Focus was on functionality, not design

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

* Improve UI/UX design
* Add search functionality
* Add filtering options
* Better cart management system
* Use advanced tools like React Query
